# TDD Examples

This project contains implementations of examples from the book "Test Driven Development".

As I read through the book, I'll be adding code examples here.

Requirements:
- .NET 9 SDK installed to build and run projects targeting `net9.0`.

Build and run (Windows):

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
```
